# AI Assistant Rules



* MUST follow all rules strictly
* MUST check existing project patterns before generating new code
* MUST decompose tasks into small units
* MUST validate assumptions before generating code
* MUST generate tests before implementation (TDD)

NEVER:

* invent new dependencies
* modify core architecture
* introduce relative imports
* create test files without documentation
